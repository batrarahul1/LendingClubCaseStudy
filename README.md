## General Information
Background:
• Lending Club is a peer-to-peer marketplace, which connects lenders and borrowers online. Borrowers apply via online
platform and are assigned an internal grade, based on which interest rates are decided.
• Lenders can then decide on whether to lend based on the loan attributes including interest rates.
• The idea is to identify these risky loan applicants, then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of
credit loss.
Objective:
• Leveraging EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis), identify additional fields for understanding the consumer and loan
attributes that influence the loan default status.
